                <h3>Important information</h3>
                <p>You or your representative must fill in the application form before seeing your medical doctor. The medical information in this application will be used for the administration of the MPS and where appropriate for the Driver Licensing Scheme. Southern Coastland Road Authority has a responsibility to ensure that all licence holders are medically fit to drive.</p>
                <p>If you hold a driver licence and Southern Coastland Road Authority needs to be notified of any medical condition, you will need to have your doctor complete Section 3 (Medical Report) of this application. The medical information will be used to verify your medical fitness to drive.</p>
                <p>In the event that any medical practitioner recommends restrictions in respect of your driver licence or certifies that you are medically unfit to drive, this may result in restrictions being placed on your driver licence or the suspension of your driver licence. Section 3 is not required to be completed if the application is for a temporary permit issued for the first time or where a previously held temporary permit has already expired.</p>
